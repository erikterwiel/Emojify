# Emojify
Emojify is an Android application that allows the user to enter a string of text which is converted into the same string but with excessive amounts of Emoji inserted.

Emojify can be found on the Google Play Store [here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=erikterwiel.emojify)

This app was made in Android Studio with both Java and Kotlin. It involved using linked lists and queues for the correct displaying of recent emojifications.
